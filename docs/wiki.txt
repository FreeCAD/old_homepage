This document describes the steps needed to migrate the FreeCAD wiki to
a different host.

1. Backing up the files

The wiki is made of 2 components: the database and the images. The
database can be backed up with a tool like phpmyadmin. The wiki is
made of 51 tables, which should be backud up in a .sql file.

The image files are located inside an images/ directory inside the
images folder. It contains several subfolders, all these folders should
be backed up (via ftp).

2. Installing the new wiki

Just download the latest tarball from the mediawiki website, unpack it
on the webhost.

3. Installing extensions

Currently installed extensions are OpenID, SyntaxHighlightGeshi and
UserAdmin. Download the tarball of each of them and unpack them in the
extensions/ folder inside the wiki folder.

4. Upload LocalSettings.php

Make a file called LocalSettings.php with the following contents, or
access path_to_your_wiki/mw-config, and a default one will be created
for you, that you can adapt with the contents below:

-------> begin of LocalSettings.php
<?php

# See includes/DefaultSettings.php for all configurable settings
# and their default values, but don't forget to make changes in _this_
# file, not there.
#
# Further documentation for configuration settings may be found at:
# http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings

# Protect against web entry
if ( !defined( 'MEDIAWIKI' ) ) {
	exit;
}

## Uncomment this to disable output compression
# $wgDisableOutputCompression = true;

$wgSitename      = "FreeCAD Documentation";
$wgMetaNamespace = "FreeCAD";

## The URL base path to the directory containing the wiki;
## defaults for all runtime URL paths are based off of this.
## For more information on customizing the URLs
## (like /w/index.php/Page_title to /wiki/Page_title) please see:
## http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL
$wgScriptPath       = "/wiki";
$wgScriptExtension  = ".php";

## The protocol and server name to use in fully-qualified URLs
$wgServer           = "http://www.freecadweb.org";

## The relative URL path to the skins directory
$wgStylePath        = "$wgScriptPath/skins";

## The relative URL path to the logo.  Make sure you change this from the default,
## or else you'll overwrite your logo when you upgrade!
$wgLogo             = "$wgScriptPath/../images/freecad.png";
$wgFavicon          = "$wgScriptPath/../images/favicon.ico";

## UPO means: this is also a user preference option

$wgEnableEmail      = true;
$wgEnableUserEmail  = true; # UPO

$wgEmergencyContact = "noreply@freecadweb.org";
$wgPasswordSender   = "noreply@freecadweb.org";

$wgEnotifUserTalk      = true; # UPO
$wgEnotifWatchlist     = true; # UPO
$wgEmailAuthentication = true;

## Database settings
$wgDBtype           = "mysql";
$wgDBserver         = "url_of_mysql_server";
$wgDBname           = "name_of_database";
$wgDBuser           = "user_of_database";
$wgDBpassword       = "password_of_database";

# MySQL specific settings
$wgDBprefix         = "wiki_";

# MySQL table options to use during installation or update
$wgDBTableOptions   = "ENGINE=InnoDB, DEFAULT CHARSET=binary";

# Experimental charset support for MySQL 5.0.
$wgDBmysql5 = false;

## Shared memory settings
$wgMainCacheType    = CACHE_NONE;
$wgMemCachedServers = array();

## To enable image uploads, make sure the 'images' directory
## is writable, then set this to true:
$wgEnableUploads  = true;
$wgUseImageMagick = true;
$wgImageMagickConvertCommand = "/usr/bin/convert";

# InstantCommons allows wiki to use images from http://commons.wikimedia.org
$wgUseInstantCommons  = true;

## If you use ImageMagick (or any other shell command) on a
## Linux server, this will need to be set to the name of an
## available UTF-8 locale
$wgShellLocale = "en_US.utf8";

## If you want to use image uploads under safe mode,
## create the directories images/archive, images/thumb and
## images/temp, and make them all writable. Then uncomment
## this, if it's not already uncommented:
#$wgHashedUploadDirectory = false;

## Set $wgCacheDirectory to a writable directory on the web server
## to make your wiki go slightly faster. The directory should not
## be publically accessible from the web.
#$wgCacheDirectory = "$IP/cache";

# Site language code, should be one of the list in ./languages/Names.php
$wgLanguageCode = "en";

$wgSecretKey = "HASH_KEY_GENERATED_AUTOMATICALLY";

# Site upgrade key. Must be set to a string (default provided) to turn on the
# web installer while LocalSettings.php is in place
$wgUpgradeKey = "HASH_KEY_GENERATED_AUTOMATICALLY";

## Default skin: you can change the default skin. Use the internal symbolic
## names, ie 'standard', 'nostalgia', 'cologneblue', 'monobook', 'vector':
$wgDefaultSkin = "vector";

## For attaching licensing metadata to pages, and displaying an
## appropriate copyright notice / icon. GNU Free Documentation
## License and Creative Commons licenses are supported so far.
$wgRightsPage = ""; # Set to the title of a wiki page that describes your license/copyright

$wgRightsText = "Creative Commons Attribution";
$wgRightsIcon = "{$wgStylePath}/common/images/cc-by.png";

# Path to the GNU diff3 utility. Used for conflict resolution.
$wgDiff3 = "/usr/bin/diff3";

# Query string length limit for ResourceLoader. You should only set this if
# your web server has a query string length limit (then set it to that limit),
# or if you have suhosin.get.max_value_length set in php.ini (then set it to
# that value)
$wgResourceLoaderMaxQueryLength = -1;

# The following permissions were set based on your choice in the installer
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;
$wgGroupPermissions['admin']['createaccount'] = true;
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
$wgGroupPermissions['user']['edit'] = false;
$wgGroupPermissions['editor']['edit'] = true;
$wgGroupPermissions['admin']['edit'] = true;
$wgEnableUploads = true;

# Enabled Extensions. Most extensions are enabled by including the base extension file here
# but check specific extension documentation for more details
# The following extensions were automatically enabled:
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Gadgets/Gadgets.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/ParserFunctions/ParserFunctions.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Renameuser/Renameuser.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Vector/Vector.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/WikiEditor/WikiEditor.php" );

# Syntax highlighting extension
require_once("$IP/extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi.php");
$wgSyntaxHighlightDefaultLang = "python";

# OpenID extension
require_once( "$IP/extensions/OpenID/OpenID.php" );
$wgOpenIDTrustRoot = "http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/";
$wgOpenIDLoginOnly = false;
$wgOpenIDClientOnly = true;

# UserAdmin extension
require_once( "$IP/extensions/UserAdmin/UserAdmin.php" );

-------> end of LocalSettings.php

5. Upload images

Upload the contents of your backed up images directory into the new
wiki's images directory. Chmod all to 755 if needed

6. Merge the database

Import the .sql backup into the new database with phpmyadmin

7. Re-run the install script

This is important to reconciliate the database (and if needed
upgrade it to a newer version of mediawiki): simply access
wiki/mw-config again, and follow the steps.
