phpbb migration

1) import the database

No big problem, simply followed the instructions from
https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/community-docs/Migrating%20phpBB%20from%20Hosted%20Apps/
with these differences:
phpmyadmin didn't accept the db dump in one piece. I did this:
- import the dbdump into a new database on sourceforge
- export all tables except post and search_wordwrap
- export each of those 2 in 2 parts: structure and data. For structure, untick "add backslashes" otherwise it gives an import error
when everything is imported:
- add "autoincrement" to post_id in posts table
- change your own password using this method:

Follow the rest of the instructions on the SF page, plus this:
- change phpbb_style to "prosilver"
- a little difference with the SF instructions above: all path to subdirectories (images, icons, avatars, attachments) are
  relative to the forum folder (use images/, not /forum/images)

2) install the support toolkit from https://www.phpbb.com/support/stk/
in the support toolkit, use "reset styles" (will reset the changes SF has been doing)

3) copy attachments:
- extract saved attachment archive
- copy files to corresponding folders inside phpbb

To backup, basically backup /files and /images/avatars/uploaded

4) cookie settings
- domain: freecadweb.org
- name: phpbb_freecad (or anything else)
- disable SSL

5) spam prevention: force first posts to be moderated.
- set new users to "New registered users" group durin 1 post in general settings
- set the posts of that group to require moderation ( https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=2033765 )
